# [Hello World! by Polkadot](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/polkadot/onboard?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=hello+world)

**Gitcoin has integrated [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) and [Kusama](https://kusama.network/) tokens (DOT and KSM) into its tech stack**, making them one of the first full integrations outside of the Ethereum ecosystem.

To celebrate the integration on Gitcoin, we are organising **[Hello World! by Polkadot](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/polkadot/onboard?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=hello+world)**, a series of challenges to bring you on a journey of Polkadot development discovery.
